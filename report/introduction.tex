\subsection{Statement of collaboration}
We started out with some pair programming in the beginning. After we out first functional program Vikor sat down and started tweaking the parameters. The report was written by both.  

\subsection{Problem statement}
Prime numbers are a quite interesting set of numbers. They share the special trait that they are only divisible by one or themselves, unlike non-primes. However, every non-prime number can be written as a series of prime number which is useful when computing data with large integers as it allow dividing a big problem into several smaller ones.
Finding this series of primes or more commonly, finding the factors of these large integers is however no simple matter and efficient algorithms are needed.

\subsection{Definitions}
	
\begin{itemize}
  \item N - Number to be factorized
  \item GCD - Greatest common divisor
  \item Kattis - Code “judge” used by KTH to test code
\end{itemize}
