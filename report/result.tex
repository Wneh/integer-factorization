The algorithm that gave the best result in kattis~\cite{kattis} by it self was Pollard Brent algorithm, with the score of 76 points. The best implementation overall was a combination of all the algorithms in the order Trial Division, Pollard Brent, Pollard's P-1 and Pollard's rho. This combination granted a score of 82 points on kattis ID 454764.

\subsection{Trial division}

Trial division were never use as a stand alone solver. It is known to be inefficient by itself and was therefore only used as a complement for finding small factors before running the other algorithms. Thus there is no specific result for trial division.

\subsection{Pollard rho}

Pollard rho granted 68 points in kattis.

\subsection{Pollard Brent}

The first version of Pollard Brent granted a humble 50 points in kattis. The second version granted 60 points. The third version granted 75 points. The fourth version granted 76 points and was the best overall.

\subsection{Pollard's P-1}

Pollard's P-1 was only used in combination with all the other algorithms and got a result of 82 points in kattis.
