The algorithm that gave the best result in kattis[2] was Pollard Brent algorithm, with the score of 76 points and kattis ID 450829.

\subsection{Trial division}

Trial division were never use as a stand alone solver. It is known to be inefficient by itself and was therefore only used as a complement for finding small factors before running the other algorithms. Thus there is no specific result for trial division.

\subsection{Pollard rho}

Pollard rho granted 68 points in kattis.

\subsection{Pollard Brent}

The first version of pollard brent granted a humble 50 points in kattis. The second version granted 60 points. The third version granted 75 points. The fourth version granted 76 points and was the best overall.
